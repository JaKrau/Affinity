# Horiseon Social Solution Services

## Description

The code provided for this site needed refactoring, I added semantic HTML and updated the style.css. The goal of this project was to improve accessability.
Working on the site required researching semantic HTML and accessability standards, this was a good learning experience.


## Installation

git clone git@github.com:JaKrau/Affinity.git

## Usage

The site features three nav items, use these or scroll down to view all content.
